# Hello World API: Django + Python Sample

You can use this sample project to learn how to secure a simple Django API server using Auth0.

The `starter` branch offers a working API server that exposes three public endpoints. Each endpoint returns a different type of message: public, protected, and admin.

The goal is to use Auth0 to only allow requests that contain a valid access token in their authorization header to access the protected and admin data. Additionally, only access tokens that contain a `read:admin-messages` permission should access the admin data, which is referred to as [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/rbac/).

[Check out the `add-authorization` branch](https://github.com/auth0-developer-hub/api_django_python_hello-world/tree/add-authorization) to see authorization in action using Auth0.

[Check out the `add-rbac` branch](https://github.com/auth0-developer-hub/api_django_python_hello-world/tree/add-rbac) to see authorization and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in action using Auth0.

## Get Started

Prerequisites:
    
* Python >= 3.7

Initialize a python virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source ./venv/bin/activate
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Setup virtual environments:
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and edit it to populate its variables.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Run the following command to generate a random secret key and add it to your `.env` file.
```bash
python manage.py generate_secret

# .env
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<generated_key>
```

Run DB migrations:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

Run the project:

```bash
gunicorn
```

## Security Configuration
### HTTP Headers
- __X-XSS-Protection__

  Default set to `0`.

  See the [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/settings/#secure-browser-xss-filter) for more details.

  But we still need to explicitly add the header to our custom [Auth0Middleware](hello_world/middleware.py), otherwise Django will not add this header by default:
  ```python
  response['X-XSS-Protection'] = 0
  ```

- __HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)__

  Disabled by default, so we need to add this configuration:
  ```python
  SECURE_HSTS_INCLUDE_SUBDOMAINS = True
  SECURE_HSTS_SECONDS = 31536000
  ```
  Note that this will only take effect for HTTPS requests. For HTTP we need to add this header to the [Auth0Middleware](hello_world/middleware.py):

  ```python
  response['Strict-Transport-Security'] = 'max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains'
  ```

  See the [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/middleware/#http-strict-transport-security) for more details.

- __X-Frame-Options (XFO)__

  Default set to `DENY`. 

  See the [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/clickjacking/#setting-x-frame-options-for-all-responses) for more details.

- __X-Content-Type-Options__

  Default set to `nosniff`.

  See the [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/middleware/#x-content-type-options-nosniff) for more details.

- __Content-Security-Policy (CSP)__

  Not enabled by default, we need to install the `django-csp` dependency and add it to the `MIDDLEWARES`. It comes pre-configured with the directives:
    - `default-src: self`
  
  We need to manually set the configuration:
  ```python
  CSP_FRAME_ANCESTORS = "'none'"
  ```

  See the [documentation](https://django-csp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#policy-settings) for more details.

- __Cache-Control__

  We need to add a custom middleware to call `add_never_cache_headers` on all responses. This will add the header:
  
  ```
  Cache-Control: max-age=0, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
  ```

  We also need to add the `Expires = 0` header to the [Auth0Middleware](hello_world/middleware.py), otherwise Django will set it with the actual date:

  ```python
  response['Expires'] = 0
  ```

  See the [documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.2/ref/utils/#django.utils.cache.add_never_cache_headers) for more details.

- __Content-Type__

  By setting the default renderer to `JSONRenderer`, it will use `utf-8` encoding by default.

  See the [documentation](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/api-guide/renderers/#jsonrenderer) for more details.

### Remove HTTP Headers

  - `X-Powered-By`: Not added by Django.
  - `Server`: There is no easy way to remove this header since it's mostly the responsibility of the environment server. On development it doesn't matter, but on production its usually `NGINX`, `Apache`, etc. which handles this header.

### CORS
Django doesn't have CORS built-in, so we need to install the `django-cors-headers` dependency and add the configuration needed on the settings.

It comes pre-configured with:
- `Access-Control-Max-Age: 86400`

See the [documentation](https://pypi.org/project/django-cors-headers) for more details.

## API Endpoints

The API server defines the following endpoints:

### ðŸ”“ Get public message

```bash
GET /api/messages/public
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "text": "This is a public message.",
  "metadata" : {
    "api": "api_django_python_hello-world",
    "branch": "basic-role-based-access-control"
  }
}
```

### ðŸ”“ Get protected message

> You need to protect this endpoint using Auth0.

```bash
GET /api/messages/protected
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "text": "This is a protected message.",
  "metadata" : {
    "api": "api_django_python_hello-world",
    "branch": "basic-role-based-access-control"
  }
}
```

### ðŸ”“ Get admin message

> You need to protect this endpoint using Auth0 and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

```bash
GET /api/messages/admin
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "text": "This is an admin message.",
  "metadata" : {
    "api": "api_django_python_hello-world",
    "branch": "basic-role-based-access-control"
  }
}
```
